# SSH-Keys-Digital-Signature-Project

This project consisted of demonstrating the functionality of cryptography when utilizing the proper commands to encrypt and decrypt a single file while utilizing SSH. I also worked on using git commit signing for a digital signature in demonstrating a unique and verifiable signature.
