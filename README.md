# SSH-Keys-Digital-Signature-Project

This project consisted of demonstrating the functionality of cryptography when utilizing the proper commands to encrypt and decrypt a single file while utilizing SSH. I also worked on using git commit signing for a digital signature in demonstrating a unique and verifiable signature.


### In the first screenshot, it shows that I first created a file with random text first. Then I encrypted the file, then decrypted it using the appropriate commands in using SSH keys and openssl.

### In the second screenshot, it demonstrates the usage of the "git commit" command and its output. It also shows the "git show --show-signature" which demonstrates a successful signature.
